Object Oriented Programming(OOP) allows programmers to create their own objects that have methods and attributes.

These methods act as functions that use information about the object, as well as the object itself to return results, or change the current object.

In general, OOP allows us to create code that is repeatable and orgaized.

Syntax:

    class NameOfClass():

        def __init__(self, param1, param2):
            self.param1 = param1
            self.param2 = param2

        def some_method(self):
            # perform some action
            print(self.param1)
